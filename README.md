# Notes
### Fundamentals: `static` method
- when you declare a variable or a method as `static`, it belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance
- _signature_ = `public static`
- method overloading is a feature of Java in which a class has more than one method of the same name and their parameters are different
- a method can have side-effects by using keyword `void` as its return type
- technically `void` methods are not implemented in mathematical functions
